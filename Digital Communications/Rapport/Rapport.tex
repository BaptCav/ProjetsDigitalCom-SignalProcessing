\section*{Abstract}
Throughout this project, we investigate the influence of multiple parameters in a simulated QPSK radio communication channel.
First, we simulate the evolution of the bit error rate regarding the signal-to-noise ratio in a perfectly synchronized environment. 

Then we study how synchronization and phase estimation affects the BER and the behavior of these algorithms under AWGN and lastly the influence of the training sequence.

In a last part, we examine the deterioration of BER due to a phase increase and how it can be reduced with differential demodulation.

\section{Ideal Bit Error Rate (BER) performances}

\subsection{Exact expression}

\caption{Gray coded bitmap from \cite{Madhow}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The exact expression of the BER is given by \cite{Madhow} and can easily be derived as:
\begin{equation}
p_{b}=Q(\sqrt{\frac{2E_{b}}{N_{0}}})
\end{equation}

\subsection{Simulation results and comparison}
In order to simulate an environment with perfect synchronization, we forced the value of $t_{samp}$. This value is corresponding to the number of samples coming from the guards bits and the delay caused by the matched filter. We also set the phase offset to $0$.
\begin{figure}[ht!]

\caption{BER comparison}
\label{BER}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
As shown in Figure \ref{BER}, the simulated values are very similar to the theoretical ones. However, for very high SNR, the BER is so small that our testing set (here 300 blocks of 1000 data bits) is not large enough to be relevant.

\section{Non-ideal synchronization and phase estimation}
\subsection{Influence of time and phase estimation on the BER}
In order to see the influence of time, we picked a SNR of $5dB$. Then we created errors in synchronization and phase estimation to see how it modifies the BER.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{minipage}[c]{.45\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{BER_SyncError.png}
\caption{BER with synchronization errors}

\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{BER_PhaseError.png}
\caption{BER with phase errors}
\label{BER_phase}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{BER_sync} shows that one single error in the synchronization is catastrophic, the BER is multiplied by 2. With a shift of 2 samples, the BER is 10 times higher.\\

Figure \ref{BER_phase} shows that phase estimation can greatly increase the BER. However, for small error (typically less than 0.1 rad) the loss is acceptable. For a better understanding of the influence of the phase error on the BER, one can look at the constellation on Fig.~\ref{Constellation}. One can see that when the noise power increases, a lot of samples are detected near a border of a decision region. Therefore, an error in phase estimation can easily move the sample in a wrong region thus creating detection errors.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Synchronization and phase estimation under AWGN}
In this part we implemented the recommended synchronization algorithm (maximum cross-correlation between the filtered signal and a copy of the training sequence). Fig.~\ref{SE} shows that this algorithm is very resilient to the noise. For a reasonable SNR, errors never occur. However, one should take into account that we used a small window (around 6 symbols) centered on the real value. In a real environment we would need another system to position the window (like a power detector). \\

In order to estimate the phase, we searched for the angle that would minimize the norm of the difference between the rotated signal and the training sequence. We can see on Fig.~\ref{PE} that the estimate is quite sensible to noise. But, as stated before, a phase error of less than 0.1 rad has a reasonable effect on the BER. It could be improved by using another algorithm, or a phase-locked loop.

\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Influence of the training sequence}

We computed the synchronization and phase estimation errors when changing the number of training bits at a fixed SNR of 0. Fig.~\ref{TSE} shows that with a training sequence of more than 20 bits, we have less than 10\% chance of having a synchronization error.\\

For the phase estimation, if we want less than 0.1 rad deviation, as we concluded before, we need at least 50 training bits. With a fixed sequence of 1000 data bits, this would corresponds to a 5\% overhead.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Training_phase.png}
\caption{Phase estimation error}
\label{TPE}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

To improve the training sequence, we need to find one that has an autocorrelation function that is similar to a Dirac. To do this, we tested a number of random training sequences for which we computed its autocorrelation function. Then we chose the one that had the autocorrelation function most similar to a Dirac. Fig.~\ref{train} shows that for a small training sequence it can improve a little the performances of the synchronization.

\section{Differential modulation}
\subsection{Influence of a linear phase increase}
First, we added a linear phase increase during the transmission of the block. This phase varies from $0$ to $\frac{\pi}{4}$. It is a modelisation of a small frequency offset on the local oscillator. Here we chose 50 training bits in order to satisfy previous requirements. With this phase increase, we can expect the phase detection to select a correct phase for the training bits. However, as the phase increase along the data symbol sequence, more and more errors will occur. For the last symbol, the $\frac{\pi}{4}$ phase shift should result in a 50\% probability of error a QPSK channel.\\

Fig.~\ref{BERphase} shows that such a phase increase greatly deteriorate the channel performances.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{BER_phase_increase.png}
\caption{BER comparison under phase increase}
\label{BERphase}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Differential modulation/demodulation}
In order to alleviate the phase increase effect, we can think to implement a differential modulator. Such a demodulation scheme would only rely on the phase shift from the previous symbol to detect the transmitted bits instead of the phase shit from the first symbol of the block. We can expect this to greatly alleviate the phase shift increase as in our model, this phase increase is slow so the phase is almost constant between two symbols.\\
Fig.~\ref{BERphase2} shows that, as expected, the differential modulation solves this issue for high SNR. We can also note that differential QPSK under phase increase gives worse BER than QPSK without the phase increase. It could still be interesting to solve this frequency offset in another way.

%Conclusion
\section*{Conclusion}
To conclude this analysis and simulation of a QPSK signal, we can say that we were able to simulate a basic QPSK channel composed of a transmitter and a receiver. The results from these simulations allowed us to verify basic results of QPSK communication. Moreover, we dealt with synchronization and phase estimation which are common issues of wireless communication and we made basic test to see how differential modulation can solve some of this problems.\\

This study, however, only used a simple AWGN channel. Further research on QPSK communication should focus on modeling and simulating more complex channels with fading.
